##How to dig into network health using Application Insights extensibility

Application Insights (AI) released the [telemetry processor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/request-filtering-in-application-insights-with-telemetry-processor/) feature that enables you to inspect, filter and modify each data point generated by the AI SDK before it is sent to the portal. This PingMeshWeb solution illustrates how implement a custom telemetry processor. See the full blog for this solution [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/implement-an-application-insights-telemetry-processor).

**Overview**:
 I’ve created a simple ASP.NET project that has a single remote HTTP dependency to fetch historical stock values.  The application is instrumented with the AI SDK and implements a “ping mesh” telemetry processor extension that inspects AI remote-dependency-data (RDD) events, parses the distinct URIs, and performs an ongoing series of TCP port pings.  The diagnostics results are then submitted as AI metrics that help isolate if a remote dependency slowdown is network related or not.  The value of this telemetry is how it helps to either implicate the network for slowdowns/failures or to clarify that the issue is higher up that stack. 

**Objectives**:
* Illustrate how you can register a custom AI telemetry processor extension and then process individual AI telemetry events
* Show how AI’s remote dependency telemetry events can be used to dynamically identify your applications dependencies at runtime
* Demonstrate how you can integrate custom code within the AI SDK to evaluate network health and performance for your dependencies
* Show how to log custom telemetry to your AI application
